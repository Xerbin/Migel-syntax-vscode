# Migel Syntax

**Migel Syntax** is a simple, experimental VS Code extension for the **Migel** programming language.
Right now, it focuses on the basics: making Migel code nicer to read and faster to write ✨

Migel itself is an experimental language designed to be **JavaScript-compatible** and **easy to work with**, without unnecessary complexity.

## ✨ Features

Even though Migel is still early-stage, this extension already gives you some helpful tooling:

### 🎨 Syntax Highlighting

* Lightweight highlighting for Migel source files
* Not a huge amount to highlight *yet*, but it still helps with readability

### ✂️ Snippets

* Handy snippets for common patterns
* Includes things like loops and other basic constructs
* Great for speeding up writing Migel code

### 🤖 Code Completion (Experimental)

* Very simple completions
* Still incomplete, but improving over time

---

## 📦 Requirements

Nothing at all — just install and you’re good to go 🙂

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* Some code completions are missing or incomplete
* Since both Migel *and* this extension are experimental, things may change or break
* Expect rough edges — feedback is welcome!
